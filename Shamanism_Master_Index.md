🪶 Shamanism — Inner Technology, Meaning-Making & Human Interface Master Index

> The Ancient and Future Interface Between Consciousness, Nature, and the Invisible

This is the canonical navigation and meaning map for Shamanism. If NousOS is system governance and Terraforming Tomorrow is planetary engineering, Shamanism is the human interface layer — how meaning, healing, and guidance are actually experienced by minds and bodies.

🧭 What Is Shamanism?

Shamanism is not superstition. Shamanism is not merely tradition. Shamanism is not opposed to science.

Shamanism is humanity’s original consciousness technology.

It represents:

Techniques for navigating inner worlds

Methods for healing psyche and community

Ways of listening to nature, symbols, and the unconscious


Core principle:

> Not all important things can be measured. Some must be journeyed.
